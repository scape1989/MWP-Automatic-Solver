Templates and lists here are used to generate unique problem data.

There are currently 194 different templates for the problems. 300 unique names, 160 unique locations, and 190 unique objects filling the templates. Along with this the numbers generated will be randomized and differentiated for dollar, float, and integer values. Percentages will be below 100 and divided by 100 in the equations. These problems were not used in training or testing in our paper. But it's kinda fun to mess around with these and see what is teachable!
