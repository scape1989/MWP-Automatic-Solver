There are N1 OB1 and N2 OB2 in the LOC1 . How many OB1 and OB2 are in the LOC1 all together ?, x = N1 + N2
NA1 has N1 big OB1 and N2 small OB1 . How many OB1 does NA1 have in all?, x = N1 + N2
NA1 had N1 OB1 . Then NA2 gave her N2 more . How many OB1 does NA1 have ?, x = N1 + N2
NA1 had N1 OB1 . Then NA2 gave him N2 more . How many OB1 does NA1 have ?, x = N1 + N2
If NA1 has N1 OB1 and NA2 gives him N2 more OB1 . How much OB1 does NA1 have now ?, x = N1 + N2
NA1 had N1 OB1 . If NA2 had N2 OB1 and gave NA1 N1 more OB1 . How many OB1 does NA1 have ?, x = N1 + N1
NA1 put N1 OB1 on LOC1 . If there were N2 LOC1 and he put the same number of OB1 on each LOC1 how many OB1 did he put on each LOC1 ?, x = N1 + N2
NA1 put N1 OB1 on LOC1 . If there were N2 LOC1 and she put the same number of OB1 on each LOC1 how many OB1 did she put on each LOC1 ?, x = N1 + N2
What is N1 plus N2 ?, x = N1 + N2
What is N1 more than N2 ?, x = N1 + N2
What is F1 more than F2 ?, x = F2 + F1
What is F1 more than N1 ?, x = N1 + F1
What is N1 added to N2 ?, x = N1 + N2
What is F1 added to F2 ?, x = F2 + F1
What is N1 added to F1 ?, x = F1 + N1
What is F1 added to N1 ?, x = N1 + F1
Add N1 and N2 ., x = N1 + N2
Add F1 and F2 ., x = F1 + F2
