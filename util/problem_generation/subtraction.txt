NA1 had N1 OB1 . She gave N2 of them to NA2 . How many OB1 does NA1 have left ?, x = N1 - N2
NA1 had N1 OB1 . He gave N2 of them to NA2 . How many OB1 does NA1 have left ?, x = N1 - N2
There were N1 OB1 on the LOC1 . N2 of them flew away . How many OB1 are left on the LOC1 ?, x = N1 - N2
There were N1 OB1 in the LOC1 . N2 of them left . How many OB1 are left in the LOC1 ?, x = N1 - N2
There were N1 OB1 on the LOC1 . N2 of them were taken away . How many OB1 are left on the LOC1 ?, x = N1 - N2
There were N1 OB1 in the LOC1 . N2 of them went out . How many OB1 are left in the LOC1 ?, x = N1 - N2
NA1 had N1 OB1 . If NA2 had N2 OB1 and gave NA1 N1 more OB1 . How many OB1 does NA2 have ?, x = N2 - N1
NA1 has N1 OB1 and NA2 has N2 OB1 . How many more OB1 does NA1 have than NA2 ?, x = N1 - N2
There are N1 OB1 and N2 OB2 on the LOC1 . How many more OB1 are there than OB2 ?, x = N1 - N2
There are N1 OB1 and N2 OB2 in the LOC1 . How many more OB1 are there than OB2 ?, x = N1 - N2
NA1 has N1 OB1 and NA2 has N2 OB1 . How many fewer OB1 does NA2 have than NA1 ?, x = N2 - N1
There are N1 OB1 and N2 OB2 in the LOC1 . How many fewer OB2 are there than OB1 ?, x = N1 - N2
NA1 had N1 OB1 . NA2 gave her some more . Then NA1 had N2 OB1 . How many OB1 did NA2 give NA1 ?, x = N2 - N1
There were N1 OB1 on the LOC1 . Some more were added . Now there are N2 OB1 on the LOC1 . How many OB1 were added ?, x = N2 - N1
NA1 had some OB1 . NA2 gave her N1 more . Now NA1 has N2 OB1 . How many OB1 did NA1 have at first ?, x = N2 - N1
There were some OB1 in the LOC1 . N1 more were put in . Now there are N2 OB1 in the LOC1 . How many OB1 were in the LOC1 to start ?, x = N2 - N1
